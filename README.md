# MattMusicSDK
MattMusicSDK - MacOS and iOS audio player xcFrameworks that give back real-time data (sound samples for drawing the waveform, FFT real and imaginary results + spectrum bins and magnitudes for drawing a spectrum analyzer, and significant spectral flux detection for syncing events to the music dynamics) for M4A, MP3, etc

Simply add MattMusicSDK xcFramework to your MacOS or iOS project, send it the filenames (the SDK keeps a playlist internally) of music in your app bundle, call play, and it gives back real-time data: sound samples for drawing the waveform, FFT real and imaginary results + spectrum bins and magnitudes for drawing a spectrum analyzer, and significant spectral flux detection for syncing events to the music dynamics. You can pause, resume or stop the music. You can jump to the next song in your playlist. The playlist can be configured to stop or re-start after the last music file is played. Fun: Any of the real-time data can be used to trigger events in your particular application or game. A sample app is included.
