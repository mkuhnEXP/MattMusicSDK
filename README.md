# MattMusicSDK
MattMusicSDK - xcFramework for audio playback of MP3, M4A, etc + real-time data (sample data for waveform, FFT real and complex results + spectrum bins & magnitudes, and beat detection) for MacOS and iOS.

Simply add MattMusicSDK xcFramework to your MacOS or iOS project, send it the filenames (keeps a playlist internally) of music in your app bundle, call play, and get back real-time data: sample data for drawing the waveform, FFT real and complex results + spectrum bins and magnitudes for drawing a spectrum analyzer, and beat detection for syncing events to the music beat. You can pause or jump to the next song in your playlist. Note: any of the real-time data can be used to trigger events in your particular application or game.
